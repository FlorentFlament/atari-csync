Title: An RGB composite sync signal generator for the Atari ST

This repository contains some verilog code to be synthesized and
programmed into a Lattice ICE40HX1K FPGA.  The main target is
`csync-predictive-prog`; it programs the FPGA, to generate a clean RGB
composite sync signal from an Atari ST H-Sync and V-Sync signal. This
allows displaying the Atari ST video outout on any RGB compliant
display device.

Usage:

```
$ make csync-predictive-prod
```

Some other targets are also available (see Makefile), they have mostly
been used to perform some experiments.

More context about this project can be found on my [Generating a clean
Atari ST RGB C-Sync signal][1] article.


## Prerequisites
